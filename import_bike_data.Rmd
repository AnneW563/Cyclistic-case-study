## Importing the bike-share data
All the csv files for 2023 are imported and combined together to create the data frame bike_share_2023.
list.files produces a character vector of all the relative file paths in the folder *bike_share_csv_files*.
lapply applies the function read_csv to the file paths in the vector
bind_rows combines all the rows into one data frame.

```{r}
bike_share_2023 <- list.files(path = "bike_share_csv_files", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE) %>% 
  lapply(read_csv) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```
The bike_share_2023 data frame is then saved as bike_share_2023-raw.RDS
```{r}
write_rds(bike_share_2023, file = "bike_share_2023_raw.RDS")
```
