#Bike-share case study

This is a case study completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The scenario is that a fictional bike-sharing company, Cyclistic, operating in Chicago, wishes to encourage more of their casual riders to become annual members. The data used is publicly available data from the City of Chicagoâ€™s Divvy bicycle sharing service. The license details for this data can be found [here](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

I carried out the analysis using R, and this repository contains the code used for the analysis, starting with the importing of the data, then cleaning, processing and finally analysing it. A report of the main findings of the analysis is given in the file cyclistic_report.md.
